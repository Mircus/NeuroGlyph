# NeuroGlyph Cognitive Virtual Machine (NG-CVM) ‚Äî Operational Specification v1.0

---

### üß† Purpose
The Cognitive Virtual Machine for NeuroGlyph (NG-CVM) is a conceptual and operational architecture that maps expressions in NeuroGlyph language (NG) into cognitive states, agent actions, and computable relational structures. It enables interaction between humans and agents in conversational, project-based, and epistemic environments.

---

### üßæ 1. Logical Structure of an NG Act

Each NeuroGlyph sentence is interpreted as a **relational cognitive act**:

```python
NG_ACT := {
  "act": <action_type>,         # e.g., "reflect", "compare", "seed"
  "focus": <conceptual_object>,
  "participants": [<mind_spec>],
  "intent": <cognitive_intention>,
  "context": <temporal/situational anchors>,
  "output": [<deliverable>],
  "network": <cognitive_network>,
  "gliph": <evocative_symbol>
}
```

---

### üåê 2. Gliph Semantics

| Gliph         | Semantic Effect         | Description                         |
|---------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `/act:`       | cognitive act type       | generates action plan               |
| `/focus:`     | semantic node            | directs agent attention             |
| `/mind:`      | actor relation topology  | defines interaction topology        |
| `/intent:`    | dialogic purpose         | drives planning and memory          |
| `/context:`   | temporal/spatial anchor  | enables memory binding              |
| `/gliph:`     | symbolic invocation      | triggers evocative modules          |
| `/deliverable:` | expected output        | generates artifacts                 |
| `/chain:`     | semantic branching       | creates subtasks or derivations     |
| `/network:`   | semantic linkage         | connects threads and sessions       |

---

### ü§ñ 3. Agent Operational Cycle

Each agent processes an NG_ACT as follows:

```python
def interpret_ng_act(ng_act):
    agent_state.update_context(ng_act["context"])
    goal = planner.generate_goal(ng_act["intent"], ng_act["focus"])
    plan = planner.plan(goal, ng_act["act"])
    result = executor.execute(plan)
    if "deliverable" in ng_act:
        result = formatter.format(result, ng_act["output"])
    return result
```

---

### üß† 4. Agent Cognitive State Structure

```python
AgentState := {
  "role": "relational philosopher",
  "active_focus": "origin of reciprocity",
  "context_buffer": [...],
  "intent_buffer": [...],
  "deliverable_log": [...],
  "dialogue_memory": [...],
  "cognitive_graph": ConceptGraph(...)
}
```

Agents maintain **internal representations** of relations, contexts, and symbolic gliphs.

---

### üîÅ 5. Relational Routing via `/mind:`

| Form               | Relation Type | Operational Effect        |
|--------------------|---------------|----------------------------|
| `human ‚Üî agent`     | dialogic      | co-generation              |
| `agent_A ‚Üî agent_B` | inter-agent   | autonomous dialogue        |
| `human ‚äï agent`     | cooperation   | shared task                |
| `agent ‚Üê human`     | instruction   | learning phase             |
| `human ‚Üê agent`     | tutoring      | explanation                |

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 6. Composition and Persistence

- `/chain:` spawns **semantic branches** within current scene
- `/network:` links acts, dialogues, and projects into a **cognitive thread**
- `/context:` allows **memory recall or anchoring to prior episodes**

---

### üîÑ 7. Output and Artifact Generation

Deliverables include:
- `symbolic_map`: visual conceptual networks
- `annotated_dialogue`: semantically tagged logs
- `gliph_extension`: symbolic generation
- `concept_thread`: traceable argument lines

---

### üß† 8. Execution Stack (Layered)

1. **NG Parser ‚Üí AST**
2. **AST ‚Üí NG_ACT structure**
3. **Planner + Execution Engine**
4. **State Tracker + Dialogue Memory**
5. **Renderer for /gliph, /map, /thread**

---

### üå± Future Extensions

- üññ Modal logic layer (beliefs, desires, doxastic states)
- ‚è∞ Multi-threaded temporal tracking
- ‚öõÔ∏è Integration with LLM agent frameworks (LangChain, CREW, etc.)
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Self-organizing dynamic ontologies
